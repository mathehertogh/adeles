"""
Infinite Completions of Number Fields

This file implements the functionality that `K.places()` claims to provide (for
`K` a number field), but does not provide, in the function
:func:`infinite_completions`.

def infinite_completions(K, fields_only=False, embeddings_only=False):
    r"""
    Return the infinite completions of the number field ``K``

    INPUT:

    - ``K`` -- a number field
    - ``fields_only`` - boolean (default: ``False``); if ``True``, only return
      the fields, not the embeddings.
    - ``embeddings_only`` - boolean (default: ``False``); if ``True``, only
      return the embeddings, not the fields.

    OUTPUT:

    A list of pairs `(L, \phi)` with `L` equal to ``RIF`` or ``CIF`` and `\phi`
    an embedding `K \to L`. The embeddings returned correspond to
    the infinite primes of `K` and they are returned in the same order as
    ``K.places()``.

    Depending on ``fields_only`` and ``embeddings_only``, only the fields `L` or
    the embeddings `\phi` are returned.
    If they are both set to ``True``, an exception is raised.

    We can obtain only the embeddings as follows::

        sage: K.<sqrt2> = NumberField(x^2-2)
        sage: infinite_completions(K, embeddings_only=True)
        [Ring morphism:
           From: Number Field in sqrt2 with defining polynomial x^2 - 2

    And we obtain only the fields as follows::

        sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^8-3*x^5+1)
        sage: infinite_completions(K, fields_only=True)
