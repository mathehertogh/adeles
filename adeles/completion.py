Infinite Completions of Number Fields

This file implements the function ``infinite_completions()``, which computes the
infinite completions of a number field `K`, i.e. the real embeddings `K \to \RR`
and the pairs of complex embeddings `K \to \CC`.
The domains of the embeddings we return are interval fields (``RIF`` and
``CIF``). As `trac-ticket #31604 <https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31604>`_
describes, the method ``K.places()`` of number fields claims to provide
embeddings into interval fields in its documentation, but the code does not
actually do this. As this ticket is not yet resolved in SageMath version 9.2,
we use the function below instead for our adèles and idèles.

def infinite_completions(K, fields_only=False, embeddings_only=False):
    r"""
    Return the infinite completions of the number field ``K``

    INPUT:

    - ``K`` -- a number field
    - ``fields_only`` - boolean (default: ``False``); if ``True``, only return
      the fields, not the embeddings.
    - ``embeddings_only`` - boolean (default: ``False``); if ``True``, only
      return the embeddings, not the fields.

    OUTPUT:

    A list of pairs `(L, \phi)` with `L` equal to ``RIF`` or ``CIF`` and `\phi`
    an embedding `K \to L`. The embeddings returned correspond to
    the infinite primes of `K` and they are returned in the same order as
    ``K.places()``.

    Depending on ``fields_only`` and ``embeddings_only``, only the fields `L` or
    the embeddings `\phi` are returned.
    If they are both set to ``True``, an exception is raised.
